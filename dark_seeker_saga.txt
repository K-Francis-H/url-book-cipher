Long before the events of the Dark Seeker Saga, in the age of fairy tales when the world was whole, Kingdom Hearts gave light to the world. However, it remained out of mankind's reach, as it was protected by its counterpart, the χ-blade. According to legend, many came to desire the light, and their greed and jealousy introduced darkness into the World. In order to conquer the light of Kingdom Hearts, people forged the first Keyblades in the image of the χ-blade, and they clashed with each other in a great Keyblade War that involved those who served the light, those who served the darkness, those who sought balance, and those who simply sought power. In truth, however, the first known Keyblades were created by the Master of Masters, who was capable of extracting them from the hearts of people using his knowledge of the χ-blade, rather than forging them. The conflict embroiled even those who did not desire Kingdom Hearts and took the lives of thousands; it also extinguished the light from the world and trapped Kingdom Hearts in the deepest darkness while the χ-blade shattered into twenty pieces: seven lights and thirteen darknesses. The final site of the Keyblade War became the barren Keyblade Graveyard, littered with ancient Keyblades. Because light remained in the hearts of children, it was able to draw the fragments of the World back together, creating several separate worlds. The remaining Keyblade wielders decided to use the Keyblade in order to protect what was left of the Realm of Light. They primarily settled in worlds within the Realm Between, such as the Land of Departure, where the Realm of Light bordered the Realm of Darkness. Memories of the Keyblade War survived in various legends, which disputed whether the Keyblade was a weapon meant to bring salvation or destruction.
